  * #6252 in fxa-content-server
    https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/pull/6252
    Submitter: shane-tomlinson
    Reviewers: vladikoff
    Commenters: jrgm,shane-tomlinson,vladikoff
      fix(authorization): Minor updates for /authorization endpoint (#6252) r=@vladikoff
      The test to see whether /authorization correctly redirects the user
      to /signup did not pass an email address and looked for the wrong
      selector. The test was fixed by specifying an email address and
      updating the selector.
      Calling /authorization w/o an `action` query parameter should
      default to send users to `/oauth` and allowing the content
      server to decide the next step based on whether a user is signed in.
      fixes #6250
