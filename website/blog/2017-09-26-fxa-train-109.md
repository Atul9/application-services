This week we shipped FxA train-109 to production,
with the following highlights:


----
FxA-0: quality

  * #5997 in fxa-content-server
    https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/pull/5997

FxA-134: Amplitude Integration

  * #6008 in fxa-content-server
    https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-content-server/pull/6008
    Submitter: philbooth
    Reviewers: vbudhram
    Commenters: philbooth,vbudhram
      fix(metrics): ensure CAD view and engage events are correct (#6008)
      Fixes #5987.
      When I added new Amplitude events for connect-another-device in
      2a707ac895477b898882bad72413e28df9fcf12b, I used the wrong trigger
      event for `engage` so ended up emitting it right after the `view`
      event instead.
      In addition to fixing that bug so that the `engage` events are now
      sane, this change adds a new `connect_device_os` event property, so
      that we can see which app-store buttons are being clicked on.

  * #60 in fxa-auth-server
    https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/pull/60
    Submitter: dannycoates
    Reviewers: zaach,philbooth,vbudhram
    Commenters: dannycoates,zaach,philbooth,vbudhram
      feat(metrics): add user properties for active device counts
      Fixes mozilla/fxa-amplitude-send#60.
      Amplitude's view of devices is skewed by the randomly-generated
      device_id that we're using until cross-project device_ids are
      implemented. And the sync_device_count property is skewed to a
      lesser degree by apparent session-related problems that seem to
      force some users to sign in repeatedly on a single device.
      To mitigate those problems, this change adds three new properties
      that indicate the number of devices that were active in a given
      time period: sync_active_devices_day, sync_active_devices_week and
      sync_active_devices_month. In this case, a "month" is 30 days.

  * #2370 in fxa-auth-server
    https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/pull/2370
    Submitter: rfk
    Reviewers: philbooth,pb
    Commenters: rfk,philbooth,pb
      fix(validation): Reject URLs with unexpected characters. (#2370); r=pb
      Previously we could accept URLs with unescaped special characters
      such as newlines or unicode, which means we were depending on other
      layers of the code to handle them correctly.  This change makes the
      requestor responsible for properly escaping any special characters
      in their URLs before passing them in to us.

  * #2368 in fxa-auth-server
    https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/pull/2368
    Submitter: philbooth

  * #2356 in fxa-auth-server
    https://github.com/mozilla/fxa-auth-server/pull/2356
    Submitter: philbooth
    Reviewers: vbudhram
    Commenters: philbooth,vbudhram
      fix(metrics): include full version information in event data (#2356)
      Fixes mozilla/fxa-amplitude-send#58.
      The user-agent parser was originally written with synthesized device
      names in mind, so it didn't always return the full version string for
      browsers and operating systems. Since then, we started using the same
      code for our event data, meaning that we're getting an incomplete
      picture of the browser/os that our users are on.
      This change tweaks the user-agent code so that it returns full version
      info, and tweaks the code for synthesizing device names so that it
      remains consistent with its old behaviour.
